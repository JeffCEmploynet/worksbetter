          Additionally, job applicants and individuals whose assignment has ended will be maintained in EWM's pool of associates to be potentially contacted about other employment opportunities.

          Your Rights and Choices
      </p>
      <p>
      EWM respects your right to access and control your information. You may exercise specific rights when authorized by applicable law as set forth below:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-2">
          <li>Access: You may access your personal data to verify that it is processed in accordance with the law.</li>

          <li>Erase: You may request that information about you be erased and no longer processed.</li>
          <li>Restrict: You may ask that EWM's Information Officer restrict the processing of your data.</li>
          <li>Portability: You may request data portability so that you can receive the personal data you originally provided in a structured and commonly used format or can request the transfer of the data to another data controller.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      In addition to the above, the California Consumer Privacy Act provides certain rights to individuals located in California.
      </p>
      <p>
      California Privacy
      </p>
      <p>
      For residents of California, EWM is committed to your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act and wants to ensure you are aware that, if applicable, you have the following rights:<br />
      Access: You have the right to request access to personal information that EWM collected for the previous 12 months. If your access request requires the disclosure of personal information of another individual, we will not be able to comply with all of your access request. Similarly, if responding to your access request would cause us to violate any law, rule, regulation, or law enforcement request, EWM cannot fulfill your request.
      </p>
      <p>
      Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete personal data that we collected from you. However, we are not required to comply with your request if one of several exceptions apply, including circumstances where it is necessary for us or our service provider to maintain your personal data in order to complete the transaction with you; internal use that is reasonably aligned with your expectations; compliance with a legal obligation; or other use of your personal data internally that is compatible with the context in which you provided it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Opt-out: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal data to Third Parties at any time. This means that once you exercise your right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, we are required to honor your request.
      </p>
      <p>
      Non-discrimination: You have the right to be free from discrimination for exercising your consumer privacy rights. EWM will not deny you goods or services, charge different amounts, or provide a different quality level of goods or services for exercising your rights unless the difference is reasonably related to the value of your data.
      </p>
      <p>
      Because processing your information is necessary to the performance of recruitment, placement, and employment or outsourcing services that EWM provides to you, a request to erase your information may result in EWM being unable to continue providing its services such as recruitment, placement, employment, or outsourcing services. Subject to applicable law, EWM may limit or deny requests or charge reasonable fees.<br />
      Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, EWM currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor's browser.

      </p>
      <p className="font-bold mt-2">
      Other Privacy Rights
      </p>
      <p>
      Under the laws of some jurisdictions, you may have the right to request additional information about the personal data we collect, request access to the personal data we process, correct an error or omission, delete personal data, or object or limit further processing. EWM adheres to applicable data protection laws, and will respect individual rights requests under those laws.
      </p>
      <p>
      Because processing your information is necessary to the performance of recruitment, placement, and employment, or outsourcing services that EWM provides to you, a request to exercise certain rights may result in EWM being unable to continue providing its services such as recruitment, placement, employment, or outsourcing services. Subject to applicable law, EWM also may limit or deny requests or charge reasonable fees.
      </p>
      <p>
      Direct Marketing
      </p>
      <p>
      EWM may periodically use your contact information to send you updates via e-mail to alert you to opportunities or services relevant to your interactions with us, such as jobs in our database that match your selected criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can opt-out of receiving direct marketing from us at any time. Each marketing communication will provide instructions on how to opt out of receiving similar emails from the registered service or resource. You can also opt-out by contacting the EWM Information Officer at ____________________________.
